Sanjeet: Hello, and thank you for agreeing to participate in our interview today. Before we dive into the questions, have you had a chance to read and agree to the disclaimer?

Participant: Yes, I've read it, and I agree.

Sanjeet: Great! Let's get started. I'm Sanjeet, and I'll be conducting the interview. Can I get your name, please?

Participant: Sure, it's Dhruv.

Sanjeet: Thanks, Dhruv. How old are you?

Participant: I'm 27.

Sanjeet: Perfect. And what is your gender?

Participant: Male.

Sanjeet: Alright, let's move on to the questions. How often do you order packages from delivery websites?

Participant: I'd say about a 7, so fairly often.

Sanjeet: Got it. Which websites do you use for online shopping?

Participant: Mostly Amazon and sometimes Walmart.

Sanjeet: Nice choices. Are there specific types of items or products you tend to order more frequently?

Participant: I often order electronics and books.

Sanjeet: Good to know. What factors influence your choice of using a particular online shopping platform?

Participant: Mostly the prices and the variety of products they offer.

Sanjeet: Makes sense. When you order packages, do you generally track the package?

Participant: Yes, I always track them.

Sanjeet: Great. Do you ever have any difficulty finding tracking numbers for different things that you ordered?

Participant: Occasionally, yes.

Sanjeet: Can you share any specific challenges or frustrations you've encountered while tracking packages in the past?

Participant: Sometimes, the tracking information isn't updated in real-time, and that can be frustrating.

Sanjeet: Understandable. Have you ever missed a package delivery because of difficulties in tracking or receiving notifications?

Participant: Luckily, no.

Sanjeet: That's good to hear. While tracking packages, do you have difficulty managing packages from different websites and shipping services?

Participant: Yes, it can get confusing, especially if I've ordered from multiple places.

Sanjeet: Have you ever thought of a system where you can track all of your packages at one place?

Participant: Yeah, that would be really convenient.

Sanjeet: If such a system existed, what would you look for in it?

Participant: I'd want it to be user-friendly and provide real-time updates for all my packages.

Sanjeet: Makes sense. Would you use a system that allows you to track all your packages from one centralized website?

Participant: Yeah, I think I would.

Sanjeet: How safe would you feel with the application being able to go through your emails for the tracking numbers for all your parcels?

Participant: I would rate it around a 4, somewhat safe.

Sanjeet: Thank you for your honesty. On a scale from 1 - 10, how often would you use a system like this over traditional tracking?

Participant: I'd say around 8.

Sanjeet: Do you believe that this system would improve your quality of life?

Participant: Yes, it would make managing packages much easier.

Sanjeet: What would you want in this system other than what was already described to you?

Participant: Maybe a feature that alerts me when a package is out for delivery or has been delivered.

Sanjeet: Great suggestion. Are there any other apps or services you often use that you'd want to be part of this system?

Participant: Maybe my calendar and a reminder or to-do list app.

Sanjeet: Fantastic. Thank you, Dhruv, for sharing your insights. This information will be valuable for our research project.

Participant: You're welcome. If such a system comes out, I'd be interested in trying it out.

Sanjeet: Noted. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Thank you again for your time!
