Sanjeet: Hi there! Thanks for joining our interview. Before we dive into the questions, have you had a chance to read and agree to the disclaimer?

Participant: Absolutely, I've read it, and I'm on board.

Sanjeet: Great! I'm Sanjeet, and I'll be conducting the interview. Can I get your name, please?

Participant: Sure, it's Yuvaraj.

Sanjeet: Thanks, Yuvaraj. How old are you?

Participant: I'm 27.

Sanjeet: Perfect. And what is your gender?

Participant: Male.

Sanjeet: Awesome. Let's jump into the questions. How often do you order packages from delivery websites?

Participant: I'd say about a 6, fairly often.

Sanjeet: Cool. Which websites do you usually use for online shopping?

Participant: I'm a big fan of Amazon, and I occasionally order from BestBuy.

Sanjeet: Nice choices. Any specific types of items or products you tend to order more frequently?

Participant: I'm into tech, so it's mostly electronics. Oh, and I can't forget about my coffee addiction, so sometimes I order coffee-related gadgets.

Sanjeet: That's interesting! What factors influence your choice of using a particular online shopping platform?

Participant: Price is a big one, but also the variety of tech gadgets they offer.

Sanjeet: Understandable. When you order packages, do you usually track them?

Participant: Absolutely, I like to know where my tech goodies are at all times.

Sanjeet: I get that. Do you ever face difficulties finding tracking numbers for different items you've ordered?

Participant: Occasionally, yeah.

Sanjeet: Any specific challenges or frustrations you've encountered while tracking packages?

Participant: Sometimes the tracking info isn't as detailed as I'd like, especially with multiple orders from different places.

Sanjeet: Got it. Ever missed a package delivery due to tracking issues?

Participant: Fortunately, no.

Sanjeet: That's good to hear. Do you find it challenging to manage packages from different websites and shipping services?

Participant: Yeah, it can get a bit overwhelming, especially with all the tech stuff arriving.

Sanjeet: Ever thought of a system that lets you track all your packages from one place?

Participant: Absolutely, that would be super convenient.

Sanjeet: If such a system existed, what features would you want in it?

Participant: Real-time updates, a sleek interface, and maybe an option to customize notifications.

Sanjeet: Great suggestions. Would you use a system that allows you to track all your packages from one centralized website?

Participant: For sure, it sounds like a time-saver.

Sanjeet: How safe would you feel with the application going through your emails for tracking numbers?

Participant: I'd rate it around a 5, moderately safe.

Sanjeet: Thanks for sharing. On a scale from 1 - 10, how often would you use a system like this over traditional tracking?

Participant: I'd say a solid 9.

Sanjeet: Do you think this system would improve your quality of life?

Participant: Yeah, it would make juggling tech orders and coffee gear a lot easier.

Sanjeet: Any additional features you'd want in this system?

Participant: Maybe a feature that suggests similar gadgets based on what I've ordered.

Sanjeet: Interesting idea! Any other apps or services you often use that you'd want to be part of this system?

Participant: Maybe my calendar, to sync delivery dates with my schedule.

Sanjeet: Great input, Yuvaraj. Thanks for your insights. If you have any more thoughts or questions, feel free to share.

Participant: Will do. Excited to see where this goes!

Sanjeet: Likewise! If there's anything else, don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time, Yuvaraj!
